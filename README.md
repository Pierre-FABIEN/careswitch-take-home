Pierre FABIEN

Hello !
Here is the project as requested. Thanks to this, I have learned a lot! I will propose a better UX/UI by the end of the week, but in the meantime, the objectives are almost reached. I encountered difficulties with Zod when updating the data, and I had to disable it for this part. I don't know why it doesn't work, but I will continue investigating. In any case, it would be a great pleasure to evolve in this development environment and to perfect my skills here! I suspect there are more qualified candidates than me for this position. If in the future you need an additional person, please do not hesitate to contact me. I would love to work on SvelteKit.
I look forward to your feedback.
