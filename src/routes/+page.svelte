		Here is the latest version of this project. Thanks to this, I have learned a lot! The objectives are almost achieved. I had difficulties with Zod when updating data and had to disable it for this part. I don't know why it doesn't work. In any case, it would be a great pleasure to evolve in this development environment and perfect my skills!
